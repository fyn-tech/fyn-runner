    The activity tracker manages jobs in two main categories: actively running jobs that are
    consuming system resources, and completed jobs that have finished execution. This helps the
    runner determine resource allocation and cleanup requirements.

    Jobs progress through three activity states:
    1. Pending: Jobs waiting to start (managed by external queue, not tracked here)
    2. Active: Jobs currently using system resources (tracked in _active_jobs)
    3. Complete: Jobs that have finished execution (tracked in _completed_jobs)

    Note:
        All operations are thread-safe using RLock to handle concurrent access from multiple job
        execution threads. The tracker does not handle pending jobs - these should be managed by a
        separate job queue system.

    Warning:
        Jobs cannot be in both active and completed states simultaneously. The tracker will raise
        RuntimeError if data corruption is detected during status updates.

        - Add job priority tracking for resource scheduling
