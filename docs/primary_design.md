# Runner High Level Design
## Design requirements.

Requirements of a the fyn-runner (presently unordered):
1. [x] Portability across OSes.
2. Must start on start up (at least default behaviour).
3. [x] Must collect data on hardware of systems.
4. [x] Must communicate hardware data to Fyn-api.
5. [x] Must communicate with fyn-api regarding job status (starting, monitoring,completion, etc)
6. Must communicate/synchronise simulation data with fyn-api (CRUD on local data).
7. Must register with fyn-api - storing secret tokens ext.
8. [x] Must be able to launch
9. Must be able to remotely pause and kill simulations.
10. Must organise simulation files.

## Major Components and Responsibility

The above requirements will be met the use of the following components.

### Job Manager (Co-ordinator)
- Central component which orchestrates everything between other components
- Manages/Maintains job queues, priorities, etc
- Determines ability to accept new simulations
- Will contains any misc. configs until we know where to put them

### Job (observer)
- Launches and runs simulations
- Tracks progress of simulation
- Tracks resources usage (optional extra)
- Can update/terminate running simulations.
- Reports outcome.

### File Manager
- Managers general working directories of the runner.
- Manages simulation i/o (where)
- Synchronisation with cloud and data-back up.
- Clean-up of old sims.

### Server Proxy  (factory - facade - proxy)
*note this class is designated to be refactored/split its evolved to be doing too much*
- Creates/builds instances of the HTTP fyn-api client (client automatically generated by openAPI) 
- responsible for periodically sending a heartbeat.
- Handles web-socket commuinication
  - handles authentication/initiation to of web-socket comms with server
  - proxy for (web-socket) communication and data transfer between runner and api (and maybe front end).

### System Integration
- Collects system relevant specs for analysis resource availability.
- Detects hardware changes and updates.
- Installation and registration of the runner.
- Tools for the user to directly interact with the runner (cmd)
- automatic updating?

## Requirements Mapping

Briefly the requirements will be fulfilled by the following components.

## UML Structure

This section 'transposes' the above into a high level design concept with a uml class diagram. The runner will be in python, so `public`/`private` aren't indicated. Utility methods and attributes are indicted with a `_` prefix. ``<<utility>>`` indicates static or non-object (collection of free functions).

## General Error Handling and Logging Approach:

In general the runner needs to be 'fault' tolerant and should try to 'keep' running even when errors do occur. Thus general crashes when errors are encountered are to be minimised. Logging will be added to the program, and configurable and reportable to the server to help identify bugs and problems. Generally for levels of messaging the following hierarchical structure is followed:

- Debugging: Additional information for diagnosing problems.
- Info: General information and progress updates.
- Warning: Some assumptions are being made to proceed, which may lead to further issues.
- Error: An serious problem has occurred by the program will attempt to continue.
- Critical: No way to continue, exit program.

In general simulations should not be terminated if the runner goes down. At some point in the future we will have a 're-attach' to running simulation. That say a runner going down should not propagate to the simulation.
